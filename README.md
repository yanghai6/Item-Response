# Students' Answers Prediction Model

* This project aims to develop machine learning algorithms to predict students’ answers to diagnostic questions based on the student’s answers to other questions and other students’ responses for online education services.

* The `part_a` folder contains three basic models for prediction: `knn.py`(Q1 a), `item_response.py`(Q1 b), and `matrix_factorization` (Q1 c), and an ensembled model `ensemble.py` (Q1 d)by bootstraping based on the Item-Response Model.

* The `part_b.py` file is an extended two-parameter IRT model based on `item_response.py` in `part_a`, the details of the model is exlained in Part B in `final_report.pdf`.

* `final_report.pdf` is the report and analysis of all models in the project.
